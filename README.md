# Project4D

This is a tiny little P3D applet which projects a 4D cube, or tesseract, into 3D space both 'orthogonally' and 'normalized'. It allows the user to rotate these tesseracts along all six four-dimensional planes of rotation and observe the effect of these rotations on the projections.

It is remarkably simplistic, I coded it in the span of about three hours, and I intend to do nothing else with it. It was just a fun project!
